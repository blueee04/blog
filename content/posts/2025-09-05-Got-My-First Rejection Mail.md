So a few weeks back i had applied to lossfunk which was an organization that allowed young researchers and students to be selected in a program where you get to work with peers with similar interests and get the exposure you need.

Thinking of such an oppurtunity that i could actually use....i hoped to get into it and filled up the form they had with upmost determination. I went through their past projects as well and it was really aligned to the things i studied in.

After a few days i got a mail....that i was not a good fit for the program and i wasn't the person that they were looking for.

No worries tho we still keep going, keep falling and keep growing :)
