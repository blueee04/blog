So a few weeks back, I had applied to Lossfunk, which was an organization that allowed young researchers and students to be selected for a program where you get to work with peers with similar interests and get the exposure you need.

Thinking of such an opportunity that I could actually use, I hoped to get into it and filled up the form they had with utmost determination. I went through their past projects as well, and it was really aligned with the things I studied.

After a few days, I got a mail saying that I was not a good fit for the program and I wasn't the person that they were looking for.

No worries though - we still keep going, keep falling, and keep growing! :)
