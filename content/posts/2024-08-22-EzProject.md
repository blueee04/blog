# EzProject: Your Discord Buddy for Assignments & Tasks

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Ever felt like keeping track of all your assignments and group tasks on Discord is a mess? EzProject is here to help! It's a Python-powered Discord bot that makes managing assignments, tasks, and deadlines super easyâ€”right inside your server.

## ðŸš€ What Can EzProject Do?

- **Add & List Assignments:** Quickly add new assignments and see what's due.
- **Task Tracking:** Log your tasks, update progress, and check things off as you go.
- **Deadline Reminders:** Never miss a due date again!
- **Role Management:** Assign roles to your friends or teammates for better collab.
- **Handy Commands:** Need help or info? There are commands for that too.
- **Slash Commands:** Use modern Discord slash commands for a smooth experience.
- **Modular Design:** Each feature is its own "cog" (module), so it's easy to add more cool stuff later.

##  How's It Built?

Here's a peek at the folder structure:

```
EzProject/
â”œâ”€â”€ bot/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                # Bot launcher
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slash_commands.py      # Slash command definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands.py            # Old-school command support
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cogs/                  # All the feature modules
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ assignment_management.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ deadline_management.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ task_management.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ role_management.py
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ utility_commands.py
â”œâ”€â”€ Datamodule/db.py           # Where your data lives
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py                  # Bot token & config
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt           # Stuff you need to install
```

- **Bot loads up all the cogs** so each feature works on its own.
- **Supports both old and new commands** (but slash commands are the way to go!).
- **Stores your data locally**â€”no fancy database needed to get started.
- **Config is simple**â€”just set your token and you're good.

##  How Do I Use It?

**Add an assignment:**
```python
@app_commands.command(name="add_assignment", description="Add a new assignment.")
async def add_assignment(interaction: discord.Interaction, name: str, due_date: str):
    ...
```

**Typical flow:**
1. You type a command (like `/add_assignment`).
2. The bot does its thing and saves your info.
3. You get a friendly reply ("Assignment added!").
4. Check or update stuff whenever you want.
