# 🧠 Student Mental Health Analysis: Understanding the Silent Struggle

In today’s fast-paced and competitive academic world, mental health among students has become a critical issue—yet it remains under-discussed and stigmatized. In this blog, we dive into a data-driven analysis of student mental health, exploring the underlying factors, patterns, and actionable insights uncovered through our research project.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Objective**:  
To analyze various demographic and lifestyle factors affecting student mental health using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

**Tools & Technologies**:  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

**Dataset**:  
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes attributes such as age, gender, course, year of study, GPA, sleep habits, and reported stress or mental health conditions.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first step in our process was **cleaning** and **visualizing** the data to uncover patterns. Key findings include:

- **Gender distribution**: Female students were slightly more represented.
- **Stress prevalence**: A significant number of students reported high stress levels and poor mental health.
- **Sleep hours**: Strong correlation between sleep deprivation (<5 hours) and increased mental distress.
- **Academic Pressure**: Final-year students reported the highest stress levels.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

We implemented two classification models to predict the likelihood of students experiencing mental health challenges:

### 1. Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy**: ~79%
- Highlights the linear relationship between features like sleep, GPA, and academic year.

### 2. Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: ~85%
- Captures non-linear relationships and provides feature importance ranking.

**Top Features Identified**:
- Sleep Hours  
- Academic Year  
- Daily Screen Time  
- GPA  

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- **Sleep deprivation** is a significant factor in poor student mental health.
- Stress increases considerably in **later academic years**.
- **Lower GPA** correlates with higher mental distress.
- **High screen time**, though less dominant, contributes to mental fatigue.

---

## 📌 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following interventions are recommended:

- 🧠 **Mental Health Workshops**: For awareness and emotional resilience.
- 📞 **Accessible Counseling**: On-campus or virtual psychological support.
- 🌙 **Sleep & Screen Hygiene**: Promoting healthy digital habits and rest.
- 🎓 **Academic Mentorship**: Pairing senior mentors with juniors to ease academic pressure.

## 💡 Conclusion

Mental health is not a standalone issue—it is a complex interplay of lifestyle, academic, and emotional factors. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we can uncover the hidden patterns that affect student well-being and design targeted interventions.

This project is one step toward fostering a more empathetic and proactive academic environment.
