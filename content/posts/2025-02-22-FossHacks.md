## How we ended up here

We got shortlisted based on our resumes (I still can't remember the exact reason — resume luck?). We traveled to Kochi and stayed at a cool place called TinkerHub for the event.

## The day starts at 4:00 AM

We woke up at 4:00 AM to catch the 5:00 AM train. Our event slot started at 9:00 AM and the hackathon was a 36-hour sprint. The train took about three hours to reach Kochi, and by the time we arrived we were starving.

After a quick round of dosas and puris, we reached the venue and the grind began.

## What we did for 36 hours

The organizers gave us the challenge, some cool swag, and enough energy (read: coffee and snacks) to keep going. We pulled a few all-nighters, debugged ridiculous edge cases, and somehow managed to ship a deployed project within the time limit. The food was surprisingly decent, which helped.

Early mornings were rough — sore backs from sleeping upright in chairs, and the classic brain-fog after a long night — but we made up for it by socializing and learning from other teams. People were building wild things, and everyone had a different specialty.

Those mornings usually looked like laptops, noodles, and a shared sense of panic-then-relief.

By the end of the hackathon we were swapping war stories about bugs that took hours to fix and features that miraculously worked on staging. The sense of accomplishment when a feature finally deployed is unbeatable.

The return trip was another story — standing in the general compartment for four hours, tired and sweaty, but buzzing from the event. We had no idea yet that we'd finish in the top five teams.

We ended up placing among the top teams — proof that late nights, teamwork, and a messy sprint can pay off. GGs — never give up.
