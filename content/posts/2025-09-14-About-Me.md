I am a 21 year old final year student, currently studying at Amrita University, Amritapuri. My major is based on Electronics but i lowkey hate it (no offense)

I like building tools and projects that make life easier and are genuinely useful to people.

So i what do i like...let's say i love to learn how the world works, how does google know what we are searching for, how does instagram not run out of storage and how does it even manage all that data....random stuff

A bit of background: I was part of bi0s (India's No.1 competitive cybersecurity team). My focus there was forensics and DFIR analysis. I've also won hackathons, including FossHacks 2025 (hosted by FOSS United), among others.

Currently i am working on Geospatial Data(Satellite and Lidar Imagery) using that for early warnings on natural disasters and climate forecasting as well(No need to fear of LandSlides Anymore!!!)

Other than those i have worked on various other projects around ESP32 sensors, GPS modules...made NIDS systems and a lot of others, checkout my github to have a look

After work you can find me at the gym or playing my guitar...or on adventures in the mountains

I like to take photos time to time so here's some of them [VSCO](https://vsco.co/not-just-blue)

I'm open to collaborations in cybersecurity, machine learning, and data science. Whether you're working on research, building a startup, or want to discuss tech, I'd love to connect.
